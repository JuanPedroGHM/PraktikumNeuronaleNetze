# How to use Kaggle Kernel for the course Praktikum Neuronale Netze

You might hear about Kaggle competitions or even you participated some of them and have a good rank. But Kaggle offers more than that: They have Kaggle Dataset to create and share Machine Learning datasets, Kaggle Learn to teach you free Machine Learning and Data Science skills, and they have Kaggle Kernel. Similar to Google Colab, Kaggle Kernel is a FREE cloud service to run code or to share coding tutorials/lectures. It also provides free GPUs (K80 at the moment of this writing). The nice thing about Kaggle Kernel is that you can associate your kernel with some Kaggle dataset, either from you or from other Kaggle kernels/competitions/users. **It is of course required that you have a Kaggle account**.    

**NOTE: Kaggle strongly prevents multiple accounts (from one single person), and associate one account with one email address and phone number. If you create a second account and then verify it using the same phone number with your old account, your new account will be disabled (with the email you used to register that new account). **

Beside other resource advantages compared to Google Colab, the way Kaggle kernels associating with datasets and allowing edits/forks makes sharing tutorial and exercise notebooks as Kaggle kernels is very easy compared to the Google Colab, even I do not think I need to give you any tutorial here. Only two small disadvantages: one is that Kaggle fast growth leads to some unknown problem of the services occasionally, the other one is that we cannot, at the moment, group kernels (into Week 1, Week 2, topic A or B or C, etc.). So I will keep updating the list of each notebook (corresponding to a kernel) here, just fork them and change the code yourself.
